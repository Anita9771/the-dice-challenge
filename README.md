### Game Mechanics
The game involves two players, each rolling a dice once. The rolled numbers are compared to determine the winner:

Player 1's rolled number: Generated randomly between 1 and 6.
Player 2's rolled number: Also generated randomly between 1 and 6.

### Implementation Details
The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code (`index.js`) handles the core game logic:

Two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated using `Math.random()` and `Math.round()` or `Math.floor()`.
The corresponding dice images are displayed based on the rolled numbers.
A winner is declared based on the comparison of the rolled numbers.
The game announces the winner with a brief delay using `setTimeout()`.
